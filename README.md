# ElijahR_boxing_game

This code creates a **boxing game**, using Javascript, where players take turns hitting each other until one hits 0 health. This is done using **if, else if, and else statements** to handle different gameplay scenarios, and **conditionals** to determine the game's outcomes and health status. The code breaks down the amount of damage into 3 different hit categories: *basic(below 6)*, *critical(6-9)*, and ***knockout(10)***.
